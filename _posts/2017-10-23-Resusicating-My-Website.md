## 2017-10-23 
Okay for a few months, I have been writing my blog in files for each date. After some of my blog post got positive responses from various blogging platform, I was encouraged to re-visit my old dream of having my own website. 

Few years back, I had purchased my domain - https://shriharshmishra.com, published the first page by building a page from scratch, but never followed up with more posts after that. I spent too much time and energy learning HTML5/CSS3 hacks to create everything from scratch. While that was a good exercise in learning Responsive Web Design ([via this book by Ben Frain ](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/responsive-web-design-html5-and-css3)), I got bogged down by the technicalities. I should have focussed on blogging. 

I decided to evaluate Jekyll and Hugo - the two top static website generator tools of the day. I will be posting my thoughts ahead.
