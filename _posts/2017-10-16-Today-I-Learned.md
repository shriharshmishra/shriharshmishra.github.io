While searching for a VIM trick,(to create a new file without leaving VIM), I stumbled upon a simple and minimalist blog by a company called Hashrocket - [Today I Learned](https://til.hashrocket.com/). I found it very interesting way to share knowledge. 

As I am trying to find ideas for the news letter I want to start for a tech committee in my company, topic are hard conjure. At times I was  trying to write on a topic which would be too complex and it takes a long time to complete. At times it would be so trivial that it wouldn't warrant an article. So after couple of articles I found it was too difficult to sustain a regular pace of information dessemination which a news letter would warrant. 

Sharing tech nuggets in the format as shown by Hashrocket is something I wanted. So here I start my tech nuggest news letter for our company. I will post an update in a subsequent article.
