#Day of Java 8

Today I have learnt something new - Lambda expression in Java language. The tutorial also reveals how lambda expression can be used with Stream, a new concept in the language which can be used with Collections. 

Next I need to learn how Streams work. 

Next important things to do today is work on the Technology Governance initiative.I am thinking of finding how hackathons and ideathons can be conducted.
