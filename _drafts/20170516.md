*The hectic day!*

With a little less sleep over last two nights, I woke up late and tired. My eyes were hurting. So I had decided that I needed to exercise today to feel fit. Other activities took a little back seat as the work in office was also terribly hectic. I had to look into a production issue. I had a funny experience where people showing attitude to me few days back were running behind me for help. The day was full of distraction and wasteful discussions with colleagues. 

So nothing productive was accomplished today. I am too tired now to do anything worthwhile. I will be better to sleep well and get up early tomorrow and work on things that I love to work on.
