A long productive day at work. 

I was able to balance out various activities that I love to do - 

- Docker
- AWS
- French
- Family Time
- Boring office work (essential)
- Vagrant 


*Vagrant and Docker*
After struggling with storage space on the office laptop, it finally clicked to me that I can use the AWS account to create a linux instance and practice Docker tutorials on it.
So I created an instance dedicated for this initiative of mine. But a fresh machine means nothing installed on it - no zsh, cool color scheme, or the stuff that I have added to my config directory for a long time. 

*Config*
I was able to clone my config repository and quickly get it up and running which was a great relief. However, I realized the I only had the dot files in the repository and not various plugins and programs that use the dot files. So the config automation project isn't complete yet. I need to find a way to store the plugin info as well. 

*Next Steps* 
I need to continue working on Docker and learn about how to manage the plugins and programs used by the config files.
