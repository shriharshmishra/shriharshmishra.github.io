#Day of Java 8 - 2 

Today I had a crash course on Java 8 collections. I was keen to understand how Streams work with Lambda expressions. Another important learning was to know how Stream collect and reduction works. It was too much information to take in one day. Maybe some hands-on will help strengthening understanding in my mind. 

The topics that I must read futher are - 

* Stream.collect 
* Parrallelism 

It is interesting to see how Java is incorporating functional aspects to lure developer who were moving towards the languages which are predominatingly functional in style. 

My goals is to utilize the new features in the language in the work that I am doing.
