Sunday 14th May 2017

An dull start to the day. Partied late on Saturday night which meant lazy start to the day. Woke up at 9 am. Did the usual stuff and spoke to the family back home. Had a brunch with friends. 

Did some other things like groceries, shopping for Devashish, spoke on phone with Mummy and Harshita.

Finally towards the end of the day, I was able to work on Docker. The docker stuff on my windows machine seemed to be screwed up. The images I had created following the tutorial wasn't working in the Swarm. However, I was able to proceed from the previous problem and was able to create docker machines and bring them in a swarm. 

Finally I didn't have the energy to proceed finding further problems with docker setup so I went thru the docker tutorial online and learnt more stuff. 

Steps for tomorrow would be to create a new Vagrant box and simply run docker on it. This way I can start afresh
