It was a day well spent. 

The major things I done today - 
- Docker
- Code review with Kaushal
- Cricket
- French

I was able to make some progress on Docker. Got it installed on Windows 7. I had problems with installing the Docker Toolbox and use it with VirtualBox. Lesson Learnt - don't upgrade something when it is running. 

I have learnt about Docker Swarm, installed Docker Toolbox on Windows. Restarting windows a couple of times did help in running Docker properly. 
Found a nice introductory tutorial on Docker here - https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox#/tutorials
