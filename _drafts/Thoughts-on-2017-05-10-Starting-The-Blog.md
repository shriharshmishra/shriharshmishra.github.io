It has been a long day. I had thought of utilizing it to finish make some progress on Docker. 
Unfortunately I couldn't do enough. 

The day started with important work for Dependent Visa for the family. Arranging all the necessary documents. 
Spent some time working with the offshore team and middleware support team. 

A lot of time was wasted in talking to Paul on random things. Working with Ashwini and Raj on their stuff. Finally at 3pm I was able to work on Docker. 

Docker Learnings
I was able to create a service using the image and run the service with 4 containers. Then I created another service and ran two services with Docker stack commands. The next thing to learn is run running docker across multiple machines. However the hard disk size on the VM laptop is a major concern. 

Tomorrow I should try creating some space on the VM Laptop or Setup docker on my mac. If I have to use Mac to learn docker, the best way would be to setup multiple guest machines using Virtual Box. With that I will be able to simulate the actual environment in a better manner. 

Furthermore - I should also find out how to use docker with vagrant. Vagrant website seems to have some new stuff I must check what new stuff is provided by Vagrant.
