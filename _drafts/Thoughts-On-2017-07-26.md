#Starting to blog live. 

For the last few days, or rather weeks I haven't been able ot blog at all. It can be attributed to my laziness. So today I start again. This time I am going to make notes of things that I learn immediately. I know it is likely to slow me down but I am going to do so as an experiement to see what are the results. 


##Database schema styles
I stumbled upon a HackerNews article about trending technologies. It contained something which I hadn't even heard of - Time Series DB. While exploring the details further, I ran into different styles of schema designs  - 

* Snowflake Schema
* Star Schema

Anyway I would like to explore how Time Series Databases are used these days.
